# SIMPLE REACT DROP-DOWN WIDGET  
This a simple Drop-Down Widget based on React-Js. 
The Widget loads Drop-Down options + suggestions from a JSON file and then renders a list of Options based on the the Text entered in the Widget's Input-Field.

The Widget behaves much like the usual HTML Select Element except that it is easily customizable & much more flexible.
Although this uses a JSON File, it is quite easy to modify the Code to fetch the same or similar Data-Structure
from a REST-API using AJAX. Axios is already part of the package.

## INSTALLATION + USAGE HINTS
Run `npm install` on the cloned package.
Once NPM finishes installing all the necessary Dependencies, run `npm start`
That's all! Afterwards, you may want to navigate to `http//:localhost:3000` - assuming that port is Free.
